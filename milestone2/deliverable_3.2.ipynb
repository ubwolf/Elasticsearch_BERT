       "    'text': \"Science diplomacy and pandemics,Ebola\\nThe Western African Ebola virus epidemic took more than 11,000 lives. Science diplomats traveled the world and worked with scientists from other countries in the hope of finding a vaccine to conquer the Ebola outbreak. The Ebola virus causes severe bleeding causing organ failure, lack of oxygen to the body, and it can lead to death. Scientists first discovered the Ebola virus in 1976 in Democratic Republic of Congo. Since then it has spread to other countries. It affected mostly West African countries. The largest outbreak of the Ebola virus from 2014 to 2016. There were over 28,000 cases. The virus had spread to Guinea, Liberia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Sierra Leone, Mali, Nigeria, Italy, the United States, and more. The virus spread to more than 17 countries. UNESCO played a huge role in preventing the spread of Ebola to neighboring cities and countries of West Africa. They funded $20,000 to a radio station in Sierra Leone to keep the people informed about the virus and the precautions that they could take in order to avoid it. Ebola did not spread to Koinadugu, Sierra Leone even though it borders the Republic of Guinea. which had 3814 cases and 2844 deathsMoreover, the United Nations and International Non-Governmental Organizations have supported the public health response to bring an end to the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). They have made huge efforts to track the Ebola virus, to find out where it moves next in order to prevent transmission of the virus. The first Ebola outbreak was discovered in the DRC in a village near the Ebola River, which gave the virus its name. The 1976 Ebola outbreak was much more contained than the 2014–2016 outbreak. The 1976 Ebola outbreak lasted about 11 weeks. There were 318 cases and 280 deaths. The death rate was around 88 percent. In contrast, the Western African Ebola virus epidemic lasted more than two years, had nearly 29,000 cases and 11,310 deaths. The death rate of the Western African Ebola virus epidemic was around 50 percent.During the Western African Ebola virus epidemic, science diplomats and other medical professionals traveled around the world to help track the outbreak. They tried to reduce the number of cases and deaths of the Ebola virus by studying the disease and testing possible vaccines or treatments to contain it. Even though it looked like they were not progressing, Scientists made huge efforts to minimize the Ebola virus. They tested many vaccines and treatments. Canadian scientists had been working on the Ebola vaccine research decades before the 2014–2016 outbreak. But, they were not making huge progress because they did not have enough funding. In 2010, Lead scientists left to do other research. But, one dedicated manager kept the research going. It wasn't until the 2014–2016 outbreak that they received more funding. In August 2014, Canada donated 3.6 million dollars to the WHO and MSF. Scientists received more than 120 million dollars from the Canadian government, the US government, and the WHO to support clinical trials during the epidemic. Canada developed the first vaccine approved by the world. Millions of dollars were spent to create the vaccine and it was developed by Merck. But it would not have happened without scientists from three different continents in multiple countries. The vaccine ERVEBO is used to protect against the Ebola virus. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in December 2019. Although there are no antiviral drugs approved by the FDA to treat people who currently have Ebola, there are alternative treatments such as: IV fluids, oxygen support, blood transfusions, and the vaccine ERVEBO, among others.\",\n",

       "    'text': 'Pandemic,Assessment,Severity\\nIn 2014, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adopted the Pandemic Severity Assessment Framework (PSAF) to assess the severity of pandemics. The PSAF superseded the 2007 linear Pandemic Severity Index, which assumed 30% spread and measured case fatality rate (CFR) to assess the severity and evolution of the pandemic.Historically, measures of pandemic severity were based on the case fatality rate. However, the case fatality rate might not be an adequate measure of pandemic severity during a pandemic response because:\\nDeaths may lag several weeks behind cases, making the case fatality rate an underestimate\\nThe total number of cases may not be known, making the case fatality rate an overestimate\\nA single case fatality rate for the entire population may obscure the effect on vulnerable sub-populations, such as children, the elderly, those with chronic conditions, and members of certain racial and ethnic minorities\\nFatalities alone may not account for the full effects of the pandemic, such as absenteeism or demand on healthcare servicesTo account for the limitations of measuring the case fatality rate alone, the PSAF rates severity of a disease outbreak on two dimensions: clinical severity of illness in infected persons; and the transmissibility of the infection in the population. Each dimension can be measured using more than one metric, which are scaled to allow comparison of the different metrics. Clinical severity can instead be measured, for example, as the ratio of deaths to hospitalizations or using genetic markers of virulence. Transmissibility can be measured, for example, as the basic reproduction number R0 and serial interval or via underlying population immunity. The framework gives guidelines for scaling the various measures and examples of assessing past pandemics using the framework.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Swine influenza,Summary\\nSwine influenza is an infection caused by any one of several types of swine influenza viruses. Swine influenza virus (SIV) or swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in pigs. As of 2009, the known SIV strains include influenza C and the subtypes of  influenza A known as H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and H2N3.\\nSwine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide. Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human flu, often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood. If transmission does cause human flu, it is called zoonotic swine flu. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection.\\nAround the mid-20th century, identification of influenza subtypes became possible, allowing accurate diagnosis of transmission to humans. Since then, only 50 such transmissions have been confirmed. These strains of swine flu rarely pass from human to human. Symptoms of zoonotic swine flu in humans are similar to those of influenza and of influenza-like illness in general, namely chills, fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, coughing, weakness, shortness of breath, and general discomfort.\\nIt is estimated that in the 2009 flu pandemic 11–21% of the then global population (of about 6.8 billion), or around 700 million to 1.4 billion people, contracted the illness—more in absolute terms than the Spanish flu pandemic. There were 18,449 confirmed fatalities. However, in a 2012 study, the CDC estimated more than 284,000 possible fatalities worldwide, with range from 150,000 to 575,000.\\nIn August 2010, the World Health Organization declared the swine flu pandemic officially over.Subsequent cases of swine flu were reported in India in 2015, with over 31,156 positive test cases and 1,841 deaths up to March 2015.',\n",

A widespread endemic disease with a stable number of infected people is not a pandemic. Widespread endemic diseases with a stable number of infected people such as recurrences of seasonal influenza are generally excluded as they occur simultaneously in large regions of the globe rather than being spread worldwide.\\nThroughout human history, there have been a number of pandemics of diseases such as smallpox and tuberculosis. The most fatal pandemic in recorded history was the Black Death (also known as The Plague), which killed an estimated 75–200 million people in the 14th century. The term was not used yet but was for later pandemics including the 1918 influenza pandemic (Spanish flu). Current pandemics include COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) and HIV/AIDS.',\n",

Science diplomats traveled the world and worked with scientists from other countries in the hope of finding a vaccine to conquer the Ebola outbreak. The Ebola virus causes severe bleeding causing organ failure, lack of oxygen to the body, and it can lead to death. Scientists first discovered the Ebola virus in 1976 in Democratic Republic of Congo. Since then it has spread to other countries. It affected mostly West African countries. The largest outbreak of the Ebola virus from 2014 to 2016. There were over 28,000 cases. The virus had spread to Guinea, Liberia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Sierra Leone, Mali, Nigeria, Italy, the United States, and more. The virus spread to more than 17 countries. UNESCO played a huge role in preventing the spread of Ebola to neighboring cities and countries of West Africa. They funded $20,000 to a radio station in Sierra Leone to keep the people informed about the virus and the precautions that they could take in order to avoid it. Ebola did not spread to Koinadugu, Sierra Leone even though it borders the Republic of Guinea. which had 3814 cases and 2844 deathsMoreover, the United Nations and International Non-Governmental Organizations have supported the public health response to bring an end to the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). They have made huge efforts to track the Ebola virus, to find out where it moves next in order to prevent transmission of the virus. The first Ebola outbreak was discovered in the DRC in a village near the Ebola River, which gave the virus its name. The 1976 Ebola outbreak was much more contained than the 2014–2016 outbreak. The 1976 Ebola outbreak lasted about 11 weeks. There were 318 cases and 280 deaths. The death rate was around 88 percent. In contrast, the Western African Ebola virus epidemic lasted more than two years, had nearly 29,000 cases and 11,310 deaths. The death rate of the Western African Ebola virus epidemic was around 50 percent.During the Western African Ebola virus epidemic, science diplomats and other medical professionals traveled around the world to help track the outbreak. They tried to reduce the number of cases and deaths of the Ebola virus by studying the disease and testing possible vaccines or treatments to contain it. Even though it looked like they were not progressing, Scientists made huge efforts to minimize the Ebola virus. They tested many vaccines and treatments. Canadian scientists had been working on the Ebola vaccine research decades before the 2014–2016 outbreak. But, they were not making huge progress because they did not have enough funding. In 2010, Lead scientists left to do other research. But, one dedicated manager kept the research going. It wasn't until the 2014–2016 outbreak that they received more funding. In August 2014, Canada donated 3.6 million dollars to the WHO and MSF. Scientists received more than 120 million dollars from the Canadian government, the US government, and the WHO to support clinical trials during the epidemic. Canada developed the first vaccine approved by the world. Millions of dollars were spent to create the vaccine and it was developed by Merck. But it would not have happened without scientists from three different continents in multiple countries. The vaccine ERVEBO is used to protect against the Ebola virus. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in December 2019. Although there are no antiviral drugs approved by the FDA to treat people who currently have Ebola, there are alternative treatments such as: IV fluids, oxygen support, blood transfusions, and the vaccine ERVEBO, among others.\",\n",
